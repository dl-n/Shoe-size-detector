# Shoe-size-detector
I made this project under my R&amp;D project and developed an algorithm to detect the size of foot using an image. I used Otsu's Global Thresholding for the segmentation and Circular Hough Transform(CHT) for reference object detection. I also developed an algorithm to find the start point and end point of the foot which may be present at any angle in the image to find the length of the foot. After finding the length, the model suggests the shoe size that will fit. I also proposed this algorithm for provision in online shopping to reduce the number of returns made due to the sizes . The whole program was written in MATLAB and a good accuracy was achieved.
